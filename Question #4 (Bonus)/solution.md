Jack's rate of visiting Alice was 8/10, while his rate of visiting Catherine was 2/10. And we know that the train comes every 10 minutes. So, if we accept that the voyage starts at 00:00, we can say that the west train arrives at 00:08 and the east train arrives at 00:10. Because in this way, there is a possibility of getting on the west train up to the 8th minute in every 10-minute periods (8/10). There is a possibility of getting on the east train at the 9th and 10th minutes (2/10). As a result, the east train comes 2 minutes after west train in every 10-minute periods. In total, he visits Catherine for 73 days and Alice for 292 days.
