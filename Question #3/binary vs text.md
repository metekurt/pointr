The two file types may look the same on the surface, but they encode data differently. While both binary and text files contain data stored as a series of bits (binary values of 1s and 0s), the bits in text files represent characters, while the bits in binary files represent custom data.

Text files are widely used file format and can be opened using any simple text editor. In text files, less prone to get corrupt as changes reflect as soon as the file is opened and can easily be undone and mostly .TXT and .RTF are used as extensions to text files.

However in binary files, different types of data (image, audio, text) can be stored in a single file. It is developed especially for an application and may not be understood by other applications. It can easily get corrupted, even a single bit change may corrupt the file. One most common example of binary file is image file is .PNG or .JPG.
